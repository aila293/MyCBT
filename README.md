# MyCBT
Native Android app to teach and guide those with depression through the process of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy. 

In the US, 10% of adults are dealing with depression at any time. Depression is highly treatable but often left untreated, partially because people with depression lack the resources or energy to see a therapist. 

Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is the most effective treatment for depression. It's a long-term, active process of changing the automatic way that your mind interprets the events in your life. The theory of CBT is that the core of depression is a set of irrational beliefs (or "cognitive distortions") that cause people to perceive the world, their life, and themselves as intensely negative even when nothing seems objectively wrong. The negative thoughts cause the negative emotions. By teaching people to recognize and combat cognitive distortions, they can eventually learn to perceive things in a more positive, healthy light.

This app will facilitate self-guided CBT by walking users through the process of 1) noticing negative emotions, 2) reflecting on their causes, 3) identifying the cognitive distortions that fuel the negative emotions, and 4) combating the negative emotions with healthier, undistorted thoughts. This process will take the form of adding entries to a journal, leaving the user with a log of personal data to monitor and reflect on (like a mood tracker).
